  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) cannot be dismissed as a mere farce. It
  needs to be deployed in action and also be eligible for the same bravery
  awards as sales or brand-building, so to say. This part of the organizational
  strategic plan is not about charity alone... in fact, there is no charity
  anywhere.
